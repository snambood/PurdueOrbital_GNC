# What is the problem we are trying to solve
Purdue orbital is commited to make an orbital class hobbyist rocket that is launched from a balloon. We come in the earliest stage of the project. This repository will include the Guidance, Navigation, Control and Simulations necessary for the project.

Currently the active development is on the Guidance portion, which uses a Model Predictive Controller. Resources used include:
